Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Time increases different with low N than with high N

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Good enough would be after 1000 simulations or a value of that order. Then price increases at the same rate as simulations/2.
