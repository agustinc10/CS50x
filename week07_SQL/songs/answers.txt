If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura?
    AVG(energy) = 0.65906, AVG(valence) = 0.48443, AVG(danceability) = 0.71646
    It could be PURPLE due to the high energy and danceability.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might
not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of
calculating this aura would you propose?
    There could be specific songs that move the averages to one way or another,
    despite not being as listened as others in the list.
    How much a song is listened should be pondered into the calculation.
